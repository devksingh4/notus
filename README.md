*Modeling the spread of COVID-19 to create various safer room layouts.*

The application takes in user-defined inputs, which include a simple user-drawn layout of the office/rooms that will be simulated, and some constants. The application then uses a Monte Carlo simulation technique to simulate people moving around in the defined layout. This simulation models the spread of COVID-19 in the environment. By modifying some variables, one can find precautions that can help lower the possibility of infection.
