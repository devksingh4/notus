# Notus
*Modeling the spread of COVID-19 to create various safer room layouts.*

## Inspiration

## What it does
The application takes in user-defined inputs, which include a simple user-drawn layout of the office/rooms that will be simulated, and some constants. The application then uses a Monte Carlo simulation technique to simulate people moving around in the defined layout. This simulation models the spread of COVID-19 in the environment. By modifying some variables, one can find precautions that can help lower the possibility of infection.
## How we built it

## Challenges we ran into

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

## What we learned

## What's next for Notus
We would first like to expand on the functionality to allow for the application to model the room layout which has the least potential spread of COVID-19. We would like to take this to various businesses so that they can reopen safely, helping keep our communities safe while aiding the economy.
